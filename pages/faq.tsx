          - you get points for hosting a node and making transactions, and you
          no longer get points directly for mining tokens. The other categories

          Additionally, we have added a number of commands to the CLI to make
          participating in the testnet simpler - these will help you set up your

          your node to be ready for testnet. Check out our{' '}

    answer: (
      <div>
        <li>
          De-incentivizing direct mining gives you the opportunity to join a
          mining pool and earn proportional shares of blocks mined by a group of
          miners. No more need for a crazy mining rig - just join up with a
          number of other miners and get a proportional share of the new tokens
          mined!
        </li>
        <li>
          And if you do have that amazing mining rig, donâ€™t worry - you will
          still be able to earn lots of points by making large transactions with
          the Iron Bank.

          First, run <code>ironfish testnet</code> to configure your node with
          proper graffiti and telemetry settings.

          Then, run <code>ironfish start</code> and leave that process running.

        Graffiti is your personal identifier. You need to set it up to get

    question: `Will my accounts transfer?`,

    answer: `Yes - accounts with identical graffiti will carry over from Phase 1. If you already created an account with your graffiti for Phase 1, you do not have to register again for Phase 2.`,

    question: `Will there be weekly limits on earning points?`,

    answer: `No - we have removed weekly point limits in Phase 2.`,
  },
  {
    question: `How will Phase 2 be fair for new users starting?`,
    id: 'phase-2-fairness',
    answer: `We have allocated blocks of the initial pool of $IRON tokens separately for Phase 1 and Phase 2. So even if you were high on the leaderboard in Phase 1, you start at zero for the Phase 2 allocation. Everyone gets an equal shot at the new Phase 2 pool of tokens, so youâ€™re not too late! `,
  },
  {
    question: `If all the miners connect to pool node only how does that help with the Phase 2 objective of telemetry/running node? Are the blocks always signed by the pool?`,
    id: 'miners-pool',
    answer: `Hosting a node with enabled telemetry earns you points directly, regardless of your participation in a mining pool. The mining of blocks is no longer worth points, so mining via pool has no bearing on your leaderboard spot. This is part of the reason we moved away from directly incentivizing mining tokens.`,
