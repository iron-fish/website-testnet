                   https://linear.app/ironfish/issue/IRO-1056/category-cards I mentioned the spacing requests.
                   Could we apply those same styles in this card but only above the NFT card itself.
                   Photo below. Let me know if this is too vague. 
- [ ] - IRO-1079 - Double the margin on the left and right sides of the NFT cards.
- [ ] - IRO-1081 - Community contribution NFT description - add, " to our entire community" to the end of that sentence.
                   Now each description will roughly be the same length, and the cards can now be the same height as one another.
- [ ] - IRO-1082 - Cute little navigation arrows - make the top margin 64px.
- [ ] - IRO-1083 - (WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR SECTION 1/2) testnet fish illustration, use attached svg
- [ ] - IRO-1085 - (WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR SECTION 2/2) Margin
                   Change margin under the button to 64px
                   Change the margin above the text of "What are you waiting for?
                   Start earning points!" to 64px.
